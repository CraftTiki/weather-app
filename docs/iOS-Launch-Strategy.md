## Part 1: Monetization Strategy

### Primary Model: Paid App

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Price | $4.99 USD |
| Positioning | "The weather app for people who hate weather apps" |
| Value Prop | No ads, no tracking, no bloat — just weather |

### Why Paid (Not Freemium)

1. **Filters for quality users** — People who pay upfront are engaged, leave better reviews
2. **Simpler business** — No conversion funnels to optimize
3. **Aligns with brand** — Premium experience = premium price
4. **Sustainable** — No pressure to add ads later when VC money runs out

### Secondary Revenue: Tip Jar

In-app "Buy me a coffee" option for users who want to support development:
- $1.99 — "Thanks!"
- $4.99 — "You're awesome"
- $9.99 — "Keep building"

Tip jars typically generate 2-5% of revenue but build community goodwill.

### Future Consideration: Premium Tier

If demand exists, add subscription ($1.99/mo) for:
- Apple Watch app
- Multiple locations (5+)
- Premium widgets
- Severe weather push notifications
- Extended 14-day forecast

**Do not launch with this.** Wait for user feedback to validate demand.

## Part 4: User Acquisition Channels

### Tier 1: High-Impact, Low-Cost

| Channel | Tactic | Expected Result |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **App Store Search** | ASO optimization | 40-50% of downloads |
| **Product Hunt** | Launch day post | 500-2,000 visits |
| **Hacker News** | Show HN post | 1,000-5,000 visits if it hits front page |
| **Reddit** | Authentic posts in r/ios, r/apple, r/weather | 200-500 downloads |
| **Twitter/X** | Consistent posting, engage with weather/tech community | Slow build, compounds over time |

### Tier 2: Medium-Effort

| Channel | Tactic | Expected Result |
|---------|--------|-----------------|

### Tier 3: Paid (If Organic Works)

Only after validating product-market fit:

### What NOT To Do

- Don't buy fake reviews (App Store will ban you)
- Don't spam subreddits (you'll get banned and damage reputation)
- Don't pay influencers until organic traction proves the product works
- Don't launch without at least 200 waitlist emails

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on app name** — This unlocks domain, social handles, App Store listing
2. **Set target launch date** — Work backwards to create development timeline
3. **Create landing page** — Start collecting emails immediately
4. **Begin iOS port** — Prioritize core features for v1.0
